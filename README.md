## 🏗️ Spatial Infrastructure
The system monitors a **100 ft x 50 ft** floor plan, strategically divided into five functional zones:

1.  **Entrance:** Control point for total conversion rate calculation.
2.  **Sales Floor:** Primary data source featuring high-engagement shelving units.
3.  **Fitting Rooms:** Lounge and trial area to analyze product attraction.
4.  **Self-Checkout:** Final transaction point for sales correlation.
5.  **Storage Room:** Restricted administrative zone.
